                <h1> Hey there! </h1>
                <p> Welcome to my web page. I'm Maksim Kirandjiski, a 20 year old computer science student from Macedonia. This web page is a homework assignment from my Basics of Web Design course. Here you'll find information about me, my hobbies and my travel experiences. I hope you enjoy it!</p>

                <h1 id="abtme"> About Me </h1>
                <p> I live in Skopje, capital of Macedonia. I have a sister who lives in France and a mother and father whom I love dearly. I like my country; it's where I grew up, where I feel comfortable and at ease. Though I do like traveling!

                    I see myself as an ambitious, caring and decent person. My overall goal is to live a fullfilling life, though I'm still working out what that means exactly. I'm enrolled in a CompSci college and I'd like to be a programmer one day.

                    I would say the three things that define me the most are: </p>

                I was blessed with a healthy and strong body (I have my father to thank for that). At around the age of 14 I started doing 200 pushups and 50 chin-ups a day. The results were incredible, and I really enjoyed working out! Though many see it as a difficult endeavor and a painful one at that, I view physical fitness as an essential road to self-love and discipline.

                I started going to the gym semi-regularly. While my physique did improve, I could tell it wasn't for me. Lifting weights was uncomfortable, janky and didn't seem to target my muscles the same way calisthenics did. But in the spirit of self-improvement and getting better at things, I'd definitely say that going to the gym is something I intend to do much more this summer!

                I spent one academic year in America through the competitive YES exchange program scholarship. It was definitely an unforgettable experience and played a massive role in the person I am today. I visited so many prominent tourist destinations that we only see in movies like The White House, The Grand Canyon, Times Square, Washington DC and Los Angeles! I met so many people with whom I still keep in touch today. Here are some pictures from my stay there that resemble some of my fondest memories:
